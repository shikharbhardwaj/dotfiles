# dotfiles

This repository has settings my development environment, along with some random
useful scripts. These include my `vim` settings and plugins, `zsh` and `tmux` 
stuff and templates for projects. Will change over time as stuff gets added or 
removed.

## Usage

Install the following : 

  * `gnome-terminal`
  * `zsh`
  * `tmux`
  * `Vim`
  * `Git`

__WARNING__: Running `install.sh` will replace config files for the software
listed above. Read the script before executing.

Clone the git repository into a local folder and run `install.sh`. 

Run vim and type in `:PluginInstall`.
