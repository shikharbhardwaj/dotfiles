# dotfiles

Settings and configuration for my development environment. These include my `vim` settings and plugins, `zsh` and `tmux` stuff and templates for projects. Will change over time as stuff gets added or removed.

## Usage

This is used on a Ubuntu machine. Place the folders (prefixing a `.` to the name) in your home folder and hopefully everything should work. Follow the instructions for [YCM](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe). Happy hacking!
