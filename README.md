# dotfiles

Settings and configuration for my development environment. These include my 
`vim` settings and plugins, `zsh` and `tmux` stuff and templates for projects. 
Will change over time as stuff gets added or removed.

## Usage

Install the following : 

  * `gnome-terminal`
  * `zsh`
  * `tmux`
  * `Vim`
  * `Git`

__WARNING__: Running `install.sh` will replace config files for the software
listed above. Read the script before executing.

Clone the git repository into a local folder and run `install.sh`. 

Run vim and type in `:PluginInstall`.
